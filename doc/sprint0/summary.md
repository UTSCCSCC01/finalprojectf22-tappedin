## The Key Principles

**Minimal** - The design of this application should mainly focus on delivering information in "bite-size" pieces, in order to not overwhelm people with too much information.

**Extensibility** - The design of this application should created in a way that allows for new features to be added without any difficulties. This will ensure that our system will always have new features making it "refreshing" and keeping user retention.

**Well-Integrated** - The design of this application should deliver the easiest way to share information from people to people.

**Customizable** - The design of this application should give users a sense of freedom on how they want to customize their public profile. This will encourage creativity and not make all profiles identical.
