## Decision Making
Decisions were made in Discord group calls or in Discord chat. Anyone was allowed to offer ideas. Then, everyone would vote on what they think is the best idea and give their reasoning. This process is repeated until everyone agrees on one idea. Responsibilities were split based on each group member's strengths. 

## Prioritizing User Stories
User story sizes were estimated using "planning poker". User stories were then prioritized by sizes obtained from planning poker. In general, user stories that bring more value to the project are prioritized. 

## Meetings
Meetings were held in a Discord call every 3-4 days. Meeting durations were held until meetings objectives were complete (approximately 30-60 minutes). Meeting times were decided based on the availability of each team member. If a team member was not able to meet at the agreed time, that person would let the team know as soon as possible and a new meeting time would be agreed upon. 

## Next Phase
Going forward, sprint retrospectives will be held at the end of each sprint, where we will discuss what we did well in the previous sprint and what can be improved for the next sprint. Learned that it is easier to work on group documents on google drive instead of using git.
