# TappedIn Retro 3

## Attendance

- Vincent
- Ben
- Arib
- Terren
- Arthur
- Sean

## Start

- Document code: either through comments or function docs. To make it easier for the reader to follow what you are doing
- Picking up tickets earlier and finishing them (our burndown chart is messed up)
- Creating Test Plans (?)
- creating tests in general

## Stop

- Going straight into implementation, having a design might prove useful
- messed-up distribution of standup meeting  posts
- having two columns both named backlog on trello

## Continue

- Handing in work earlier which we did this sprint
- Pr's going in earlier than past sprints
- we were able to standardize branch names as discussed last time

## Action points

- Have more comment in order to improve readability, and debugging
- Constantly update tickets
- Add reminder bots to put standup messages

## Best Experience in Sprint 3

We now have a page that displays all the information about a particular user, that is available for the public. We now have a public facing page (no need to be logged in) that many people can view.

## Worst Experience in Sprint 3

Cutting it close with PR reviews and deadlines, rushing to merge everything at the end.
