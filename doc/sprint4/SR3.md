## Attendance

## Start

- Document code: either through comments or function docs. To make it easier for the reader to follow what you are doing
- Picking up tickets earlier and finishing them (our burndown chart is messed up)
- Creating Test Plans (?)
- creating tests in general 

## Stop

- Going straight into implementation, having a design might prove useful
- messed-up distribution of standup meeting  posts
- having two columns both named backlog on trello

## Continue

- Handing in work earlier which we did this sprint
- Pr's going in earlier than past sprints
- we were able to standardize branch names as discussed last time

## Action points

- Have more comment in order to improve readability, and debugging
- Constantly update tickets
- Add reminder bots to put standup messages
