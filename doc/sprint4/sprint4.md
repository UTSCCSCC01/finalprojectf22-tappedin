## Team Capacity

Last sprint we took up 75 points work of stories, which was a very large amount of work. However, we were able to finish and have all planned features working on time.
So we believe this estimation is not too far off and we can probably complete around 75 - 80 points of work each sprint. Therefore this time we have decided to take 86 points of work. We are giving ourselves more work, but we believe this is still an achievable amount of work, as we still had a little wiggle room last sprint.
