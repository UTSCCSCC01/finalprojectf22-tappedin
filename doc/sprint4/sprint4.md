## Team Capacity

Last sprint we took up 86 points work of stories, which was a huge amount of tasks. However, we were able to finish and have all planned features working on time.
This time we had a couple more points with a total of 93 points, with this we can change our team capacity estimate from 75 - 80 (which was the estimate last sprint) to 80 - 90 points.  If this sprint goes smoothly, we can probably up our team's capacity to around 100 points, the capacity keeps going up every sprint since all of us are getting more and more experience with the code base and tech stack.
