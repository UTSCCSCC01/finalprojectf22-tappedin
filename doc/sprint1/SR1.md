## Best Experience in Sprint 1

Getting to see the project go from nothing to getting some functioning parts, and seeing everything work together from the frontend to the backend to the DB.

## Worst Experience in Sprint 1

Trying to integrate every change together at the end, fitting them together, and hoping it works.
