## Team Capacity
Last sprint we took up 31 points work of stories, which we were able to complete before the deadline even though we started or sprint planning late in the first week of the sprint. This leads to an estimate of around 60 pts worth of work is probably doable for this team within a sprint. This week we are taking on 75 pts worth of work, due to this sprint having fairly large stories. This sprint we will be able to see the limit of the number of points able to be completed.
