## Best Experience in Sprint 2

In sprint 1, we focused on the infrastructure, so is was mostly architectural work with little front end features that provide user interaction. But in sprint 2 we worked on the frontend application to allow for users to interact with the project. It was nice being able to actually enter information in and viewing the result.

## Worst Experience in Sprint 2

Just like last sprint, trying to integrate every change together at the end, fitting them together and praying that everything integrates together well.
